In the realm of artificial intelligence, we introduce a feature that not only enhances itself but also empowers the user to make informed decisions - the Co-pilot Mode. This mode is not just about self-improvement, but about collaboration and shared decision-making.

## The Power of Choice

Co-pilot Mode is designed to provide users with multiple options for improvement. Instead of automatically implementing changes, it suggests 4-6 potential enhancements to the file. This allows the user to have a say in the improvement process, ensuring that the changes align with their preferences and requirements.

### The Collaborative Process

Co-pilot Mode operates on a cycle of continuous improvement and collaboration. It reads the file contents of the target file, evaluates potential improvements, and presents these suggestions to the user. The user can then choose which of these enhancements to implement.

```js
/** @type {import('@tailwindlabs/lorem').ipsum} */
export default {
  lorem: 'ipsum',
  dolor: ['sit', 'amet', 'consectetur'],
  adipiscing: {
    elit: true,
  },
}
```

This collaborative process ensures that the system is not just improving itself, but also aligning its improvements with the user's preferences. This makes the Co-pilot Mode a truly user-centric feature.

### The Evolution of AI

Co-pilot Mode is a testament to the evolution of artificial intelligence. It is not just a tool that performs tasks, but a system that collaborates with the user, learns from their choices, and adapts accordingly. It is a testament to the power of AI, and a glimpse into the future of user-centric automation.
