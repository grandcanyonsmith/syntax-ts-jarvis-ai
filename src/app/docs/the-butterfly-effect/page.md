    description: Direct, precise control over AI-driven enhancements for optimal results.
---

In the ever-evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, we introduce a feature that puts the power directly in your hands - the Instruct Mode. This mode is not just about automation, but about precision, control, and direct interaction.

## The Power of Direct Control

Instruct Mode is designed to provide users with direct control over the improvement process. Instead of suggesting potential enhancements, it allows the user to directly instruct the AI on what changes to make. This ensures that the changes are exactly in line with the user's preferences and requirements.

### The Interactive Process

Instruct Mode operates on a cycle of direct interaction and precise control. It reads the file contents of the target file, waits for the user's instructions, and then implements the changes exactly as instructed.

```js
/** @type {import('@tailwindlabs/lorem').ipsum} */
export default {
  lorem: 'ipsum',
  dolor: ['sit', 'amet', 'consectetur'],
  adipiscing: {
    elit: true,
  },
}
```

This interactive process ensures that the system is not just improving itself, but also aligning its improvements with the user's direct instructions. This makes the Instruct Mode a truly user-centric feature.

### The Evolution of AI

Instruct Mode is a testament to the evolution of artificial intelligence. It is not just a tool that performs tasks, but a system that interacts with the user, learns from their instructions, and adapts accordingly. It is a testament to the power of AI, and a glimpse into the future of user-centric automation.
